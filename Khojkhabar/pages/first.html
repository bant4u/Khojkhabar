                            <span id="firstNews"> In Patan in Baitadi district, CPN-M workers looted the voter name list from election officers, police said. The registration process came to a halt after the incident. The district electoral office has decided to resume work from Thursday with police personnel guarding the registration centre. In Chaturale VDC in Nuwakot district, a group of men looted a laptop, a webcam and a fingerprint device from the election officers.
Krishna Prasad Chapagain of the district electoral office said five unidentified men stormed the house that was lodging two female election officers and robbed them off the equipment. The men reportedly told the election officers that they had no affiliation with any party.
In Kalikot, CPN-M activists obstructed the voter registration drive in Sipkhana and Malkot VDCs, said Bikas Chandra Sharama, the district electoral officer. Following the incident, the electoral office is making preparations to carry on with the work at local police stations, Acting Chief District Officer Yam Bahadur Buda Magar said.

                            <span id="secondNews">Dear Mr Baidhya, the world is laughing at you for your silly action – disturbing the voter registration process and looting laptops and other accessories, which could be considered as anti-national action. Nepalese are cursing you and your comrades for looting, killing thousands of innocent people, destroying development infrastructures etc. Why do not you give up the bad habits and lead a normal life. If you do not like the 11 point agreement made by the 4 major political parties, you should take revenge with them, burn their offices or do harm to them, if you are strong and brave enough. But for GOD sake do not disturb the election process. Nepalese in Nepal need a strong stable government to finalise the constitution and develop the country. Are you against finalizing ‘constitution’ and are you an anti-development person? Do not create ‘hell’ in this country. We have suffered a lot. If you continue misbehaving with the people, soon they will destroy you.</span>
